# Kaggle-Survey-2021-analysis
## Statement
Egypt Governoment has realized the huge gap between their universities education and the world market demand.
Especially in data science and programming domains. 
## Repo Objective
We are here to use kaggle survey datasets to measure the success of the Egyptian Endeavour.
## Focus Group
The Egyptian participants ( with less than 3 years experince in coding ).
As I consider they were the most impacted by at least one of the Egyptian government initiations.
## Approach
* First we will compare the number of Egyptian participants in kaggle survey in the past three years 2019 , 2020 and 2021 as an indication of the total Egyptian kaggle users.
* We will focus in the rest of the analysis on the participants who have less than three years of coding experience as they were the most impacted by the recent Egyptian initiatives.
## Content Outlines
